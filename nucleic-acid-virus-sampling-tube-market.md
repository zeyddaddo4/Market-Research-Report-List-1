<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nucleic Acid Virus Sampling Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inactivated</li><li>Non-inactivated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nucleic acid virus sampling tube market is categorized into two main types: inactivated and non-inactivated samples. Inactivated tubes contain viruses that have been rendered non-infectious, providing safety for handling and analysis while still allowing for effective nucleic acid extraction for diagnostics. Non-inactivated tubes, on the other hand, preserve the live virus, making them suitable for research where active viral replication or pathogenicity studies are needed. Both types play crucial roles in viral detection and research applications.</p></p>
