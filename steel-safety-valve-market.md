<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Safety Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring-Loaded Pressure-Relief Valves</li><li>Dead-Weight Pressure-Relief Valves</li><li>Pilot-Operated Pressure-Relief Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steel safety valve market consists of three main types: spring-loaded pressure-relief valves, dead-weight pressure-relief valves, and pilot-operated pressure-relief valves. Spring-loaded valves utilize a spring mechanism to open and relieve pressure, making them suitable for various applications. Dead-weight valves rely on a weight to maintain pressure equilibrium and are ideal for high-pressure situations. Pilot-operated valves use a small pilot valve to control the main valve's opening, allowing for precise pressure regulation in complex systems.</p></p>
